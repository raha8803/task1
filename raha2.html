    <h1><b>FOOD is Life</b></h1>
    <p>
       Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal,
       or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
       The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life,
       or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their
    metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

            Fast food
            <p>Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service.
               It is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served 
               in packaging for take-out/takeaway. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters,
                travelers and wage workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.[1]

              The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
               primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced, pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef 
               patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".</p>
